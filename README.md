# Chronicle Ad
  
![](data/cct_ad1.jpg)  
  
This repository contains a script to generate the [Center for Computational Thinking's](http://computationalthinking.duke.edu) Chronicle ad mailer.  
  
To generate the image, navigate to the `code` directory, ensure you have all of your libraries installed, and source the script. Then, uncomment the final line, and run that function. The code will save a PDF in the `data` directory.  
  
Try it a few times for different backgrounds!
